notes about listener performance

it needs to keep track of the url at the beginning and end of a test (esp if a link is clicked)

it needs to catch the enter event in input fields

it needs to handle textareas

it needs to wait for a bit if the event is a click

realistic html is malformed and so you have to be able to id things by other means than just id and class e.g. xpath.

Testing on dakuto:

the test info leaves the box when the page switches/reloads (need to persist to database)
the text area entry is not tracked
the url before needs to be the same but the url after will be different everytime and so test will fail if you enforce that urls must be equal
don't say "first" if it's the entire test is just one click unless you add the before and after urls

Testing on twitter:

it doesn't handle the remember me case where the username and passwords are already pre-filled with values..

--> should detect form submissions when click is triggered can check siblings/relatives of clicked element
